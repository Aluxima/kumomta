### Discord

The KumoMTA Discord server is intended for real-time communication about
KumoMTA and MailOps/Deliverability in general. The Discord server can be found at
[https://kumomta.com/discord](https://kumomta.com/discord). Please use the #get-help channel to post your questions and be sure to include information on what version of KumoMTA you are using, your configuration, and full error messages.

### Forum

The KumoMTA forum is best suited to longer-form help requests that benefit from
higher visibility in the community (as the help request won't get lost in the
chat scroll or otherwise missed), and which would be of benefit to other users
thanks to the more permanent nature of forum interactions. The forum can be
accessed at [https://forum.kumomta.com](https://forum.kumomta.com).
