# consecutive_connection_failures_before_delay

Each time KumoMTA exhausts the full list of hosts for the destination it
increments a `consecutive_connection_failures` counter. When that counter
exceeds the `consecutive_connection_failures_before_delay` configuration value,
KumoMTA will then delay all of the messages currently in the ready queue,
generating a transient failure log record with code `451 4.4.1 No answer from
any hosts listed in MX`.

The default value for this setting is 100.
