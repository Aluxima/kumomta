# enable_tls

Controls whether and how TLS will be used when connecting to the destination.
Possible values are:

* `"Opportunistic"` - use TLS if advertised by the `EHLO` response. If the peer
  has invalid or self-signed certificates, then the delivery will fail. KumoMTA
  will NOT fallback to not using TLS on that same host.

* `"OpportunisticInsecure"` - use TLS if advertised by the `EHLO` response.
  Validation of the certificate will be skipped. Not recommended for sending to
  the public internet; this is intended for local or lab testing scenarios.

* `"Required"` - Require that TLS be advertised in the `EHLO` response. The
  remote host must have valid certificates in order to deliver to the site.

* `"RequiredInsecure"` - Require that TLS be advertised in the `EHLO` response.
  Validation of the certificate will be skipped.  Not recommended for sending
  to the public internet; this is intended for local or lab testing scenarios.

* `"Disabled"` - do not try to use TLS.

The default value is `"Opportunistic"`.

  return kumo.make_egress_path {
    enable_tls = 'Opportunistic',
  }
