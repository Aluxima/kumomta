# What is KumoMTA?

KumoMTA is an open-source Message Transfer Agent (MTA) designed for high-performance outbound email functionality.

The KumoMTA project was founded by a group of email industry veterans with decades of experience building and managing high-performance On-Prem MTAs and is supported by a community of some of the largest senders in the world. While paying attention to the lessons of history, KumoMTA was designed from the ground up with new tech as opposed to modifying something that already existed.
