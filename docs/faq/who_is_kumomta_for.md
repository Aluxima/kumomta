# Who is KumoMTA For?

Because it is designed for high-performance sending environments, KumoMTA is for experienced email operations professionals who are accustomed to high-performance sending environments and familiar with DevOps practices. Those sending less than one million messages per month will likely be better served by a more general-purpose MTA such as [Postal](https://docs.postalserver.io/).
