# Installing KumoMTA for Production Use

FIXME

## Using a Docker container for commercial mailing
Download a Docker container as described in the docs.
Deploy as a standalone or in K8


## Run as root after the build

Once you have built the package you can run as root separately like this:
sudo ~/kumomta/target/release/kumod --policy simple_policy.lua
