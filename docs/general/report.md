# How to Report Bugs or Get Help

This section described the process for submitting a bug report and how to get assistance.

## Submitting a Bug Report

Before submitting a bug report, please try and verify that what you're encountering is truly a bug and has not been previously reported:

* Check the online manual at [https://docs.kumomta.com](https://docs.kumomta.com). The manual is updated frequently and contains the latest information on the proper use of KumoMTA. The [Changelog](https://docs.kumomta.com/changelog.html) help identify any issues that may be solved by updating to a more recent release of KumoMTA.
* Check the issues list at [https://github.com/kumomta/kumomta/issues](https://github.com/kumomta/kumomta/issues) to see if the bug you've identified has already been reported.

If you think you have found a previously unreported bug, open a new issue in the KumoMTA issue tracker at [https://github.com/kumomta/kumomta/issues](https://github.com/kumomta/kumomta/issues).

If you submit an issue, please keep the following in mind:

1) **NOTE: The Issue tracker is not a support channel.** Any issues submitted that are questions and not bug reports will be summarily closed. See below for information on getting help.
2) Be sure to include the following information:
    * The Operating System of your KumoMTA installation, including Linux distribution name and version.
    * The version of your KumoMTA installation.
    * A thorough description of your install environment, including hardware specifications, whether the environment is physical or virtual (and if so, details on the virtualization environment).
    * A thorough description of the action or scenario that caused the bug.
    * Any error messages encountered must be included in the Issue report. Copy and paste the error message into your report, do not try and reproduce it from memory.
    * Relative log lines and configuration information to help reproduce the bug. Be sure to sanitize any PII or security credentials.
    * Details of any resolution steps you have taken so far.
    * If you built KumoMTA from source, be sure to include all details of the development environment, including the version of Rust being used.
3) Remember that the fastest path to resolution is to prevent any back-and-forth with the developers to gather further information. We can always act on an issue report with too much detail, but not one with too little.
4) If possible, download and install the latest release of KumoMTA and check whether it solves your problem. All official KumoMTA releases are thoroughly tested and should work without issue. We strive to maintain backwards compatability, allowing you to switch versions of KumoMTA without issue.

## Getting Help

Community support for KumoMTA is available both in the forums and in the community Discord server. Paid support customers should consult their support SLA document for information on how to contact KumoMTA support and their relevant guaranteed response and resolution times.

### Discord

The KumoMTA Discord server is intended for realtime communication about KumoMTA and MailOps/Deliverability in general. The KumoMTA team also hosts weekly office hours in the Discord server to better engage with the KumoMTA community. The Discord server can be found at [https://kumomta.com/discord](https://kumomta.com/discord).

## Forum

The KumoMTA forum is best suited to longer-form help requests that benefit from higher visibility in the community (as the help request won't get lost in the chat scroll or otherwise missed), and which would be of benefit to other users thanks to the more permanent nature of forum interactions. The forum can be accessed at [https://forum.kumomta.com].
